            <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <p>
             As a PhD graduate from the Department of Civil Engineering at McMaster University, my research focuses on integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with numerical simulation techniques. This multidisciplinary approach has led me to explore various projects, expanding my knowledge and understanding of diverse methodologies.
            My expertise lies in three key areas:
            Computational Mechanics
            Statistical Modeling (including AI)
            AI-Computational Mechanics Integration
            This website serves as a platform to showcase my academic and industrial projects, demonstrating the practical applications and advancements in these interconnected fields. Through my work, I aim to illustrate how AI can complement and enhance traditional computational mechanics, leading to more efficient and accurate simulations across various engineering disciplines.
